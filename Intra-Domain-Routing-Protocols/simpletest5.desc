The router network in the given test case is to test the Dijkstra's algorithm(shortest path)
In this topology, there are four nodes and five links. The link delays are different, and there is no link failure. 
The event list contains only one event: a packet transmission from node 1 to node 4 at time 1.00. 
The expected shortest path from node 1 to node 4 is (1,2,4).
